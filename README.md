### About me :wave:
Hi, I'm Guilherme, and I've been working as a QA professional since 2021. My journey into technology began in 2016 when I started studying electronics engineering, but it was during that time I discovered a passion for programming. This led me to pursue a career in Quality Assurance, where I found my true calling. In this portfolio, I aim to share my expertise in QA and highlight the practical skills I've developed through formal education, self-study, and hands-on experience as a test analyst.

### My experience :office:
I started my career as a Junior Test Analyst at Stefanini, after being selected through a hackathon. It was my first exposure to programming for testing, and I was amazed at how quickly I adapted. Since then, Iâ€™ve experienced significant growth, progressing to a Mid-level Tester. My role involves overseeing the software quality, creating automation test cases and reporting bugs or defects. Along the way, I've honed both my technical and soft skills, including attention to detail, communication, analytical thinking, and a solid understanding of test automation.
